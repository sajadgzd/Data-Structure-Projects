Running statistician tests:
TEST 1:
Testing next, reset, length, sum, and mean (62 points).
Test 1 passed.


TEST 2:
Testing minimum and maximum member functions (7 points).
Test 2 passed.


TEST 3:
Testing the + operator (7 points).
Test 3 passed.


TEST 4:
Testing the * operator (7 points).
Test 4 passed.


TEST 5:
Testing the == operator (7 points).
Test 5 passed.

If you submit the statistician now, this part of the
grade will be 90 points out of 90.

The TA will give you another
0 - 10 points by looking into your program.
