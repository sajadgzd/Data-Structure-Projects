//You will write all of this file, which will have the invariant of the sequence class,
//the implementations of all the member functions of the sequence class,
//and the Big-Os of these functions.
//You should write the time analysis in the comment lines of each function.  The breakdowns of points (of 100) will be the followings:
//Basis points (70) if your implementation passes the seq_ex3 exam
//Invariant of the class (5 points)
//Run time analysis (15 points)
//Other implementation details such as compiling warning, code styles and efficiency, etc. (10 points)
